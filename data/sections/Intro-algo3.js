    `
    <p>Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its completion. It's generally a good practice to try to keep the time required minimum, so that our algorithm completes it's execution in the minimum time possible. We will study about <a href="time-complexity-of-algorithms" target="_blank">Time Complexity</a> in details in later sections.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Before going deep into data structure, you should have a good knowledge of programming either in <a href="/c/" target="_blank">C</a> or in <a href="/cpp/" target="_blank">C++</a> or <a href="/java/" target="_blank">Java</a> or <a href="/python/" target="_blank">Python</a> etc.</p>
