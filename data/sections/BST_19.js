        <p>BST is a collection of nodes arranged in a way where they maintain BST properties. Each node has a key and an associated value. While searching, the desired key is compared to the keys in BST and if found, the associated value is retrieved.</p>
        <p>Following is a pictorial representation of BST</p>
