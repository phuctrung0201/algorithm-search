        <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The value of the key of the left sub-tree is less than the value of its parent (root) node's key.</li>
            <li>The value of the key of the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to the value of its parent (root) node's key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as</p>
        <pre style={{ display: "block", backgroundColor: "#eee", border: "1px solid #999" }}>{`
            left_subtree (keys) < node (key) â‰¤ right_subtree (keys)
        `}</pre>
