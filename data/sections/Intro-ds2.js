    `<html>
    <p>As we have discussed above, anything that can store data can be called as a data structure, hence Integer, Float, Boolean, Char etc, all are data structures. They are known as <b>Primitive Data Structures</b>.</p>
    <p>
    Then we also have some complex Data Structures, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of <b>Abstract Data Structure</b> are : 
    </p>
    
    <li><a href="13">Linked List</a></li>
    <li><a href="16">Tree</a></li>
    <li>Graph</li> 
    <li><a href="10">Stack</a>, <a href="11">Queue</a> etc.</li></ul> <p></p>
    <p>All these data structures allow us to perform different operations on data. We select these data structures based on which type of operation is required. We will look into these data structures in more details in our later lessons.

    <p>The data structures can also be classified on the basis of the following characteristics:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered">
    <tbody><tr><th>Characterstic</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Linear</td><td>In Linear data structures,the data items are arranged in a linear sequence.
     Example: <b>Array</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Non-Linear</td><td>In Non-Linear data structures,the data items are not in sequence.
     Example: <b>Tree</b>, <b>Graph</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Homogeneous</td><td>In homogeneous data structures,all the elements are of same type.
     Example: <b>Array</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Non-Homogeneous</td><td>In Non-Homogeneous data structure, the elements may or may not be of the same type.
     Example: <b>Structures</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Static</td><td>Static data structures are those whose sizes and structures associated memory locations are fixed, at compile time.
     Example: <b>Array</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dynamic</td><td>Dynamic structures are those which expands or shrinks depending upon the program need and its execution. Also, their associated memory locations changes.
     Example: <b>Linked List created using pointers</b></td></tr>
