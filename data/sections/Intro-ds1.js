    </div><p>Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have some data which has, player's <b>name</b> "Virat" and <b>age</b> 26. Here "Virat" is of <b>String</b> data type and 26 is of <b>integer</b> data type.
    </p>
    <p>
    We can organize this data as a record like <b>Player</b> record, which will have both player's name and age in it. Now we can collect and store player's records in a file or database as a data structure.
    <b>For example</b>: "Dhoni" 30, "Gambhir" 31, "Sehwag" 33</p>
    <p>If you are aware of Object Oriented programming concepts, then a <code>class</code> also does the same thing, it collects different type of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.</p>
    <p>In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various operations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.</p>
