    <p>Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the course of its execution. Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited memory is available.</p>
    <p>An algorithm generally requires space for following components :</p>
    <ul class="content">
    <li><b>Instruction Space:</b> Its the space required to store the executable version of the program. This space is fixed, but varies depending upon the number of lines of code in the program.</li>
    <li><b>Data Space:</b> Its the space required to store all the constants and variables(including temporary variables) value.</li>
    <li><b>Environment Space:</b> Its the space required to store the environment information needed to resume the suspended function.</li>
    </ul>
